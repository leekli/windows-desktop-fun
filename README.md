This is my attempt to recreate the Windows XP Classic Theme desktop using only vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript DOM manipulation.

It's a bit of fun, and a little hobby project to help me get deeper into CSS and DOM events ðŸŽ‰

<strong>It's been mostly built and tested with the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://brave.com/">`Brave Browser`</a>, and `Safari`.</strong>
